# unsupervised-project
The Dataset was collected from UK-based and registered non-store online retail. Our main objective is to identify the patterns of transaction and segment the customers. Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups based on their shared behavior or other attributes. The groups should be homogeneous within themselves and should also be heterogeneous to each other.
The main goal is to identify customers that are most profitable and the ones who churned out to prevent further loss of customer by redefining company policies. Having large number of customers, each with different needs it is crucial to find which customer are most important for business and target them with appropriate strategy. Used Elbow method and Silhouette analysis to find best number of clusters.
